GitFolio is an AI-driven platform designed to automate the creation of professional web portfolios for computer science professionals and students. 
By transforming static resumes into dynamic, personalized websites, GitFolio eliminates the need for coding expertise, providing an accessible solution for 
individuals seeking to enhance their online presence. The system integrates AI-powered resume parsing, chatbot-assisted customization, and automated deployment 
to GitHub Pages, enabling users to generate and publish high-quality portfolios effortlessly. The intellectual merit of GitFolio lies in its innovative application 
of natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and AI-driven content extraction to streamline portfolio creation. By leveraging 
transformer-based models for chatbot interactions, Jinja2 templating for structured HTML generation, and React for real-time previews, the platform ensures an 
intuitive and adaptive user experience. Our system's architecture combines PyPDF2 and pdfplumber for robust information extraction with a lightweight frontend that 
provides immediate visual feedback during the customization process.
Beyond its technical innovations, GitFolio has a significant societal impact by democratizing access to professional web portfolios, particularly benefiting 
students and early-career professionals who lack web development experience. This increases their competitiveness in the job market while reducing time investment 
from hours to minutes. Furthermore, GitFolio serves as a scalable model for AI-driven career development tools, demonstrating how automation and NLP can enhance 
digital self-presentation in professional contexts. GitFolio represents a transformative approach to professional self-presentation, bridging the gap between 
technology and career advancement. By combining AI, NLP, and web automation, GitFolio offers an efficient and accessible means for individuals to establish a 
strong digital presence, contributing to broader innovations in AI-driven career support systems.
