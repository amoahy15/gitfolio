# GitFolio
CS 329 Computational Linguistics 


Abstract

GitFolio is an AI-driven platform designed to automate the creation of professional web portfolios for computer science professionals and students. 
By transforming static resumes into dynamic, personalized websites, GitFolio eliminates the need for coding expertise, providing an accessible solution for 
individuals seeking to enhance their online presence. The system integrates AI-powered resume parsing, chatbot-assisted customization, and automated deployment 
to GitHub Pages, enabling users to generate and publish high-quality portfolios effortlessly. The intellectual merit of GitFolio lies in its innovative application 
of natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and AI-driven content extraction to streamline portfolio creation. By leveraging 
transformer-based models for chatbot interactions, Jinja2 templating for structured HTML generation, and React for real-time previews, the platform ensures an 
intuitive and adaptive user experience. Our system's architecture combines PyPDF2 and pdfplumber for robust information extraction with a lightweight frontend that 
provides immediate visual feedback during the customization process.
Beyond its technical innovations, GitFolio has a significant societal impact by democratizing access to professional web portfolios, particularly benefiting 
students and early-career professionals who lack web development experience. This increases their competitiveness in the job market while reducing time investment 
from hours to minutes. Furthermore, GitFolio serves as a scalable model for AI-driven career development tools, demonstrating how automation and NLP can enhance 
digital self-presentation in professional contexts. GitFolio represents a transformative approach to professional self-presentation, bridging the gap between 
technology and career advancement. By combining AI, NLP, and web automation, GitFolio offers an efficient and accessible means for individuals to establish a 
strong digital presence, contributing to broader innovations in AI-driven career support systems.

- Backend ~ Integration Developer (Joseph): Demonstrate how text analysis will be implemented, establish ChatGPT-based resume processing pipeline
- DevOps ~ Project Manager (Robert): Manage technical feasibility discussions and project scope, prepare documentation, handle ChatGPT API integration and cost management, 

April 1-7: Implement file upload functionality which should allow users to upload resumes and process them
- Team (Meeting April 1 in Libs Room 112): Decide model portfolio website
- Frontend (Humphrey): Build UI for file uploads
- Backend ~ Computational Linguist (Charlington): Develop a resume, cover letters, CVs parsing module
- Backend ~ Integration Developer (Joseph): Import portfolio website model
- DevOps ~ Project Manager (Robert): Ensure smooth file handling on the server

April 8-14: Integration of necessary external tools and imports with the intention of providing smooth execution of text extraction and web generation within the project
- Team (Meeting April 8 in Libs Room 103): Agree on test cases for integration
- Frontend (Humphrey): Work on integrating any new UI elements required by the external tools like feedback widgets or progress indicators related to file parsing and API responses
- Backend ~ Computational Linguist (Charlington): Implement NLP preprocessing
- Backend ~ Integration Developer (Joseph): Implement OCR preprocessing
